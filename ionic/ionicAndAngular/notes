ionic start --list informs of available templates you can begin coding with.

ionic --list gives over commands

ionic serve from within project directory will serve project with live-reloading.

the:
'ionic platform add android'
command adds platform specific resources to project so that we can use the android emulator.

you must use the actual device if you want to test properly.

App Structure:
- src - most of app is in here.
      - index.html is main SPA.
      - app contains app.module.ts (start of angular app)
      - pages folder is where different pages of the app are stored.
        - each page folder has: html, scss and, ts file for class related code.
      - theme provides global variables.
- don't modify anything in www file.
- config.xml is for Cordova app.


## Navigation

The Navigation Stack:
  New pages are pushed onto the stack during navigation.
  Pages are popped off when you go back.
  Supports Multiple Navigation stacks
  Each app has a Root stack

To navigate we use the NavController services .push() and .pop() functions.

Navbar comes with an automatic back button.
Navbars must be placed within an ion-header element.

We can pass any valid JS object as a Nav Parameter

Tabs within a component creates another navigation stack which can cause strange bugs.
Be careful!

## Working with HTTP and Lifecycle Events

Set up backend


Create service to interact with HTTP
Work with Promises
Lifecycle Events Overview
Load Data within lifecycle
Working RxJS
Loading component
Working with third party Libs

Lifecycle Events:
- ionViewDidLoad - only loads when the page is added to the navigation stack (page is cached)
- ionViewWillEnter - runs every time before view is navigated to
- ionViewDidEnter - Always fires, right after shown to user.
- ionViewWillLeave - 
- ionViewDidLeave
- ionViewWillUnload
- ionViewCanEnter - good for authentication
- ionViewCanLeave - good for guards, early page exit (save unsaved data e.g.)
