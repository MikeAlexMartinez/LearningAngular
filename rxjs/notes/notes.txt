# Ngrx in Angular #
===================

Ngrx applies the 'flux' / 'redux' like state management pattern in order to make
state management more logical and simple to manage.

Presentational components should be as 'dumb' and as simple as possible.
presentational components should be concerned with rendering the UI and not with 
containing the complex business logic.

Allows you to inject a single thing into the components of the application.

Allows you to implement OnPush change detection.

Components display state, and can dispatch actions to change state
in the store.

Reducers listen for actions that are dispatched and carry them out.

You shouldn't perform effects (impure usually async actions that cause side-effects, e.g. server
communications) within a reducer, these should be handled elsewhere. Effects would communicate
with a http service.

when effects are used, you would strip out the prior reducer and would the reducer would capture
actions dispatched by the effects function and then the state will be updated after a successful
server-side communications actions.
