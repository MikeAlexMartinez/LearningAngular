## Sample app architecture

key
=p> primary routes
=c> child routes
=s> secondary routes

Main => app =p> Welcome
            =p> Login
            =p> Product List =p> Product Detail =p> Product Edit =c> Edit Info
                                                                 =c> Edit Tags
                             =p> Product Edit =c> Edit Info
                                              =c> Edit Tags
            =p> Product Edit =c> Edit Info
                             =c> Edit Tags
            =s> Message

Angular Modules

## How

- Url is changed
- router checks paths for first match
- process redirect if exists
- process route guards
- resolve data
- activate component(s)
- Display template(s)

## Routing Basics

a base href if required in the index.html of the application.

RouterModule comes with two methods.

RouterModule.forRoot() & .forChild()

forRoot()

delcares router directives
manages route configuration
registers the router service
used once.

declares directives,
manages route config.
does not register service.
Used in feature modules.

redirects are local and only happen once.

routerLink directive needs to be added to template to activate routes.

Browser url styles.

HTML5 style and hash based object.

web apis allow access to history urls to control text in address.
Can prevent browser reload.

# based leverages url fragements and prevents a reload.

HMTML5 is a It's a more

{useHash: true} in router config activates hash-style urls.

checklist:
Setting up
- base path
- add router module and use .forRoot() in app module.
- use forChild for feature routes.

configuring routes
- path: url segment for route
- no leading slash
- empty for default
- ** fro wildcard
- normally include a component.
- component must be imported.

Order MAtters!

router-outlet directive tells you where to place component.

routerLink directive is an attribute for a clicable element.
- enclose in square brackets.
- bind to a link paramters array, first element id the root url segment.

## Routing to Features

An angular feature module is an angular module created with the express
purpose of organising the components for a specific application 
feature area.

Setting up feature routing
- import router
- configure routes
- activate routes

naming strategies
- using common route path names expresses a relationship between features.

Module routes are imported above those imported directly. 

## Routing with Code

Uses the Router Service in @angular/router

define dependency in constructor.

then you can define method to handle routing with code.

When a string syntax is used [] brackets can be left off.

navigateByUrl() method clears any additional routes. (entire set is replaced)
navigate() retains the secondary route information.

## Route Parameters

placeholders must first be defined.

router parameters need to be unique.

array for route can be build up with separate entries.

the ActivatedRoute service provides a component with access to route paramters.

You can either use a snapshot method with a property matching the required name,
or you can use an observable so that the template updates when required.
